# Multimodal Search using Weaviate

With Weaviate, we can perform semantic searches to find similar items based on their meaning. This is done by comparing the vector embeddings of the items in the database.

As we are using a multimodal model, we can search for objects based on their similarity to any of the supported modalities. Meaning that we can search for movies based on their similarity to a text or an image.
